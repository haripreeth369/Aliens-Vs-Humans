# Aliens vs Humans - Codecademy Portfolio Project
### Overview
Welcome to the project for JUnit Testing. In this project, you will create a Java project on your own computer that contains all of the elements that we’ve covered in this course.
### Project Objectives:
Here is a summary of the project objectives. More details about each objective can be found in the Kanban board for this project:
- *Consider which traits between your entities will be inherited and which will be unique per entity.*
- *Come up with unique traits and abilities for your Human entity.*
- *Come up with unique traits and abilities for your Alien entity.*
- *Create classes for your entities and an environment for interaction.*
- *Implement your unique ideas and write JUnit Tests as code is added.*
### Project Notes(by me):
This is a basic little portfolio project to help show experience with most java concepts and JUnit5 testing. The idea of the project is to design two class objects that represent Humans and Aliens. These classes will have some amount of traits and abilities that are either shared between them or unique to themselves. It will be necessary to create another class inherited by both that contains shared traits and abilites. They’ll then be placed in an environment where they can directly interact and affect one another. The code is completely open ended and created top down by me.

Some unique ideas I added to the concept:
- *A superclass MapObject inherited by all entities and objects that are put in the environment map.*
- *An Obstacle object which allows the creation of trees, holes and rocks on the map.*
- *Aliens and Humans both have an Accuracy and a Dodge attribute which affects their ability to hit their opponents.*
- *Aliens have a home planet, whilst Humans have a home country.*
